# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
#### My name's Zain and I'm currently a CS and Stats student at the University of Toronto. I'm a voracious learner and want to showcase my projects and interests here. I'm particularly inclined towards topics in Backend Engineering, Machine Learning, AI, and Systems Programming. I also have secondary interests in Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, and Embedded Systems.
